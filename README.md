## Data Sources

The application works with three CSV data files:

1. `pool_occupancy.csv`: Contains actual occupancy measurements
   ```
   Date,Day,Time,Occupancy
   ```

2. `capacity.csv`: Contains maximum capacity data
   ```
   Date,Day,Hour,Maximum Occupancy
   ```

3. `week_capacity.csv`: Contains weekly capacity data for lanes
   ```
   Date,Day,Hour,Maximum Occupancy
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_POOL_OCCUPANCY_CSV_URL` | URL to fetch pool occupancy CSV data |
| `VITE_MAX_CAPACITY_CSV_URL` | URL to fetch maximum capacity CSV data |
| `VITE_WEEK_CAPACITY_CSV_URL` | URL to fetch weekly capacity CSV data |

## Operating Hours
