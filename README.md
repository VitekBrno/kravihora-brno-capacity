## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Data Sources

The application works with two CSV data files:

1. `pool_occupancy.csv`: Contains actual occupancy measurements
   ```
   Day,Time,Occupancy
   ```

2. `capacity.csv`: Contains maximum capacity data
   ```
   Day,Hour,Maximum Occupancy
   ```

The data is continuously updated with real-time measurements.

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_POOL_OCCUPANCY_CSV_URL` | URL to fetch pool occupancy CSV data | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VitekBrno/kravihora-brno/main/data/pool_occupancy.csv` |

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure these variables before starting the application.
